    <h2>Jared Gonzalez</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Jared Gonzalez. I am from Guatemala. I'm 22 years old. I live with my mother, my brother, and my sister. I enjoy learning new things. I like to play video games like Valorant and League of Legends. Programming is fun and interesting.</p>
    <p>I am currently studying Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my whole life. I served as a missionary in Mexico Villahermosa. My favorite scripture is Mosiah 2:22: And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land, and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.  </p>
    <p>I am looking forward to learning a lot of new things.</p>
