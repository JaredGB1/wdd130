They are known for their infectious pop music, cute and colorful concepts, and fun music videos. The name "Twice" was chosen to reflect the group's desire to capture fans' hearts through their music and performances and their formation process through the survival show "Sixteen" My favorite Twice songs are: Cheer Up, Cry for me, and Alcohol-Free. I like Alcohol free because the song makes me relax. I enjoy Cry for me because of the music vibes and the choreography. Cheer up is a song that will make you happy when you hear it.</h3>
